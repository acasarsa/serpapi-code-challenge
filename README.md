# Extract Van Gogh Paintings Code Challenge

## Project Overview ü™¥

This Ruby-based application is developed to extract specific information from a Google Scrolling Carousel embedded within an HTML file. It aims to collect the following details:

- the painting's title,
- an array of extensions ( the date the painting was created ),
- encoded thumbnail data, and
- the associated Google search link.

The gathered information is compiled into a JSON array and exported for convenient use.

## Technology Stack üíª

- **Ruby**: Core programming language
- **Nokogiri**: HTML parsing
- **Watir**: Headless browser functionality
- **RSpec**: Testing framework
- **MiniMagick & Base64**: Comparing encoded images with expected data

## Features üöÄ

- **Precise Extraction:** Accurately extracts painting names, dates, encoded thumbnail data, and Google search links.
- **Handles Edge Cases:** Manages placeholders and non-visible images gracefully.
- **Adaptable:** Able to extract data for various HTML file structures that use Google's scrolling carousel.
- **Flexible Output:** Exports extracted data as a convenient JSON array. Gives the option to only extract specific indexes by passing an index array to the `extract` method
- **Demo & Development Tools:** Includes scripts for easy experimentation and setup (bin/demo, bin/setup, bin/console).

## Install üì•

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:acasarsa/serpapi-code-challenge.git
cd serpapi-code-challenge
```

### Set bin permissions

There are several automated bin scripts to help help with install, demoing and running the program. \
To ensure that bin directory scripts are executable s permissions using the following command:

```shell
chmod +x bin/*
```

### Install dependencies

use convenient `bin/bash` command to install dependencies or `bundle install`

```bash
bin/setup
```

## Run Tests üß™

Run tests to see that all pass

```shell
bundle exec rspec
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Basic Extraction

This will generate an `output_data.json` file with the extracted data. Run it with the default file_path or get the `relative_path` for `salvador-dali-paintings.html` and run it with that.

```bash
bin/run
bin/run spec/fixtures/salvador-dali-paintings.html
```

### Demo / Playground

This will bring you to a `pry` session with an initialized extractor and parser ready to go. There are two sessions so you can exit into the 2nd one to try it out with a different html file. There are included helpers that will allow you to compare the encoded image data as well. See `self.demo` [`google_carousel_extractor.rb`](./lib/google_carousel_extractor.rb).

```bash
bin/demo
```

### Console

To open a console with project-specific settings, use:

```bash
bin/console
```
